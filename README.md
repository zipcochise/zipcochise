- 👋 Hi, I’m @zipcochise
- 👀 I’m interested in the future, selling for startups, rescuing boxers and hound dogs, as well as reading history, jazz and country music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and the basics of machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my first Kaggle competition team. Do you need some #beginnersmind on your team?
- 📫 How to reach me is fairly easy on Twitter @zip_cochise or on Mastodon @zipcochise@sigmoid.social.
