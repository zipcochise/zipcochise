- 👋 Hi, I’m @zipcochise. Feel free to call me zip. 
- 👀 I spend a bunch of time on the future, learning and grappling with GTM problems, monopoly busting, canine rescue and equine therapy, woodworking, rivers, flyfishing, reading history, and listening to soul or country music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Python and machine learning to build useful, fun, and cool things.
- 💞️ I’m just starting to learn about Kaggle competitions. Which means I'm super new to the scene.
- 📫 How to reach me is fairly easy on Twitter @zip_cochise or on Mastodon @zipcochise@sigmoid.social.
