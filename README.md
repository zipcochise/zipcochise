- 👋 Hi, I’m @zipcochise. Feel free to call me zip. 
- 👀 I’m interested in the future, learning and grappling with GTM strategy, busting monopolies, canine rescue and equine therapy, woodworking, river conservation, reading history, hip hop and country music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Python and machine learning to build useful, fun, and cool things.
- 💞️ I’m just starting to learn about Kaggle competitions. Which means I'm super new to the scene.
- 📫 How to reach me is fairly easy on Twitter @zip_cochise or on Mastodon @zipcochise@sigmoid.social.
